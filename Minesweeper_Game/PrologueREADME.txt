Hello! Welcome to the wonderful world of Minesweeper!

I am independant being and did not seek help from other life forms to do my own code (collab log). I added a long list of features into this code from leaderboards with an indicator on your score (if you are good enough to make it on the leaderboards) to it's own Secret Game.


***********SECRET GAME ADVERTISMENT***********

Are you a Minesweeper pro who wants a challenge? Well look no further! You just stepped into the most extreme version of Minesweeper EVER! 100 Mines too easy? WELL NOW FACE 101 MINES!!!! Not satisfied? Well, now space monsters trying to eat are chasing you while shooting heat seeking vortexes at you! How is this even remotely minesweeper you ask? Well, you have to use your knowledge of minesweeper to solve the puzzle while avoiding up to 101 monsters chasing you. You can pull some Dragon Ball Z/Naruto shit against these monsters with boosts and teleporting! You aren't a lil bitch and wanna be able to kill these monsters in cold blood you say? Well, luckily for you this isn't some cheap horror game! If a monster tries to eat you alive while you are standing on a square with a mine, BAMMMMMM! MONSTER GUTS ALL OVER YOU. You are actually a lil bitch and are afraid of gore you say? Well, since we are a low budget team there is no gore!!!


If (you happen to be one of the like 3 people who have access to this code on radius) {
YOU CAN PLAY!!!!!
} else {
  BE SAD!!!
  }

I am at a point where I made something I really proud of. I made all of my ideas come true and it is extremely statisfying and I had a ton of fun with the assignment. Now facing a deadline, the next step I would take is to clean up and optimize all of the code to make it "readable" code. While everything works, it could be a lil messy and I would condense using functions and organize things in an order that makes more sense.
